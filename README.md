This most recent update of my Ask the Tarot app has been built using React v18.2 and TypeScript with Vite.

In order to update this app from the original React paradigm, several changes were made:
* switched from Create React App to Vite to improve performance;
* refactored all JavaScript to TypeScript, adding strict TypeScript checking;
* updated Styled Components;
* added type definition files for context types and environment variables;
* implemented automatic batching (new React 18 feature) for improved performance when updating multiple states;
* used modern hooks and patterns.
